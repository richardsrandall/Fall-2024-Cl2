In the 3-30 pm logfile from 15:30 to 17:00, I had the other sensor board connected. It doesn't seem like it worked too well.

The 11-30 AM logfile contains a few cycles of the WWTP test, then 2 radical counts.
The 3-30 pm logfile, after the dud trials, contains another 2 radical counts.
The span dial on the main sensor board was not changed between the sets of radical counts, though the sensor was unplugged and replugged.
I realized that on the second set of radical counts (and possibly the first), we were still flowing a little bit of toluene, and also
the node hadn't been adequately covered with UV blockers in the last 2. So I did one final trial that I believe to be the most accurate,
though its result isn't really different from the previous 2 cycles.

It's possible that a voltage spike at the very beginning of the day, circa 10am, had some effect on the readings. However now the Cl2 
node seems to be working completely normally.

Left it to run with the Cl2 closed after I went home so as to check that the baseline is what we think it is.

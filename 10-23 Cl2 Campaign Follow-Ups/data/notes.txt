Began by trying to diagnose why the sensor board read mostly correctly at 30+ ppl Cl2 but had a baseline of 52mV.
Some fiddling led to a hypothesis that it's an issue of loose electrical connection, which seems to be working so far.
Replaced the connections to the LabJack with multimeter probes, which caused the baseline reading to return to 39-40 mV.
At 12:15pm I adjusted the board span with 3/4 of a turn clockwise to boost the 30 ppm signal from 55mV to 64mV.
Another 3/4 clockwise at 12:45 to get it to 72mV.

Confirmed linearity of sensor.

Did a 'baseline' CH4 removal trial with a bypass and a 'baseline' radical count, in case anything's changed since our previous ones.

At 4:30, realized I might have messed up and forgotten to cover the teflon tube by the chlorine tank. Re-doing the Cl* count quickly.
Doesn't appear to have made much of a difference.

At 4:40, moved the light to 22".
The Thorlabs power meter is acting strangely. I've reverted from PyOpticon to the thorlabs app for the sake of reliability.
The 'on' period from 4:40 to 4:45 is the reading at 11". The higher reading from around 4:45 is with the light moved further.
The power meter reading increases with the light further because the meter is now in the direct cone of light from the LEDs, rather 
than just getting diffuse reflectance.
First attempt is using 135 sccm of total flow, the minimum possible with the 100 ppm Cl2 tank.
Conversion was just a tad too low, so moved the light to 21" then 20", so we can use the 1000 Cl2 tank.
Finally settled on 18", which gave a steady state of 41.8mV, off a baseline of 61.5mV.

Next morning -- moved to 27", set flow to 75, moved again to 25".


Monday 12-9:
- 11:15-13:00, tried to redo 100 ppm tank calibration for 18" position. We seemed to get 87% Cl2 conversion to Cl*, so didn't move the light.
- Ran out of 100 ppm after that.
- Rigged water-cooled LED panel after that with 1000 tank. 14:15 was a dud. 14:40 was radical count.
- Power supply stabilized to read 36V and 3.5A; I have iphone pictures to confirm.
- 15:15 and 15:45 are identical conversion trials with the powerful light. Second one used the Picarro. Manual bypass.
- 17:00, re-did 18" trial with residence time calculated with 100 tank. 16:45 is a dud; too much oxygen.
- 18:30, re-did trial in default configuration, 200 sccm of flow and 11" light.

Using 20 ppm Cl2/N2 tank

Swapped out the 200 ppm node with a 20 ppm node.
Re-zeroed: 1 full turn CCW --> 42.3 mV when flowing humid air
Re-spanned: 5 full turns CW --> 180.2 mV when flowing 20 ppm Cl2/N2
Turning off Cl2 returned the node to 41.6 mV...

Using 10ppm CH4/N2 tank, ran 2,5,10 ppm Cl2 sweep with CH4 at 2ppm.
Note MFM read 215 sccm (should be 200 sccm).
Because of flow limits humidified CH4 and O2 (fixed at 80 sccm) and used "Humid N2 MFC" as dry N2. Cl2 MFC also provided dry flow. So 80 sccm humidified --> ~35% RH

Using 1000ppm CH4/N2 tank, ran 5,10,15 ppm Cl2 sweep with CH4 at 5ppm. Then ran 10ppm both Cl2 and CH4.
Because of flow limits, humidifed all gases (but Cl2 MFC), and selected LF N2 and HF N2 depending on flow rate. Humid N2 MFC not used.
	Note: this means the humidity changed across these cycles (50-150 of 200 sccm humid)

Dec 17: 10ppm CH4 tank again to get 1ppm and 5ppm Cl2 @ 2ppm CH4. All gases through humidifier. Humid N2 dry.
